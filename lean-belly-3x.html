                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">The most dominant ingredient of Lean Belly 3X is Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA), which is scientifically assumed to decrease body fat while toning the muscles. It is a non-stimulant and is typically taken with proper diet and exercise. The second most important ingredient is its BioPerine, an extract that can burn fats before they even have the chance to become stored fat cells in our body.
<br>
